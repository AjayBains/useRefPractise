# useRef hook practice

- The value of useRef hooks persists between renders.
- The change in Value of useRef wont cause the re-render unlike state where chang ein state causes re-render
- We can use useRef to grab a DOM node.But make sure you dont start overusing it,keep your code reactfull,going javascript way in react application is bad practise ,as it can start interferring with the state management of react application
